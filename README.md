# App Growth Engine for iOS v1.0.1

Hook Mobile has developed a unique and powerful tool for mobile app developers to market your app: App Growth Engine (AGE) SDK. This open source library allows you to integrate AGE into your iOS application.


# Getting Started
Step 1: Register your iOS App with Hook Mobile

To use the SDK, you first need to <a href="signup.html">create an account</a> and <a href="add-app.html">register your application</a> with Hook Mobile. You will need your app key when setting up your app in Xcode.

Step 2: Install the iOS SDK

Before you begin development with the AGE iOS SDK, you will need to install the iOS development tools and download the AGE SDK.

* Install <a href="https://developer.apple.com/devcenter/ios/index.action">XCode</a>
* Download <a href="http://bit.ly/GiOSHM" target="_blank">AGE iOS SDK (GitHub)</a>

To install the SDK, copy all files under AppGrowthEngine/SDKClasses to your XCode project. You should also copy over the SBJson library files if your application does not already have them (e.g., if you use the Facebook iOS SDK, you would already have SBJson). In addition, you need to add the following two iOS SDK frameworks to your project as dependencies:

* AddressBook.framework
* MessageUI.framework
